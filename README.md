Run this ONCE `git clone https://github.com/ADanilychevJr/FinalProj133.git`

Everytime you start working (before changing any files):

When you are satisfied that you finished work and want to send it to the master copy in the cloud:
`git add "your file name"`
`git commit -m "some comment about what you added" `
`git push origin master` (This sends to Github)

#####Extra commands: 

To see your local status: 
`git status` (this shows you what has been changed, committed etc)
